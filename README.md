# InVoice-OCR
InVoice OCR is an application that tackles the task of extracting key information from invoice images. It leverages the power of Streamlit, a Python framework for building web apps, and a large language model (LLM)

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

# Streamlit Interface: 
Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface where users can upload their invoice image. This can be a simple drag-and-drop area or a file upload button.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Once uploaded, the invoice image is processed using an OCR engine. This engine converts the image text into a machine-readable format, typically plain text.

Large Language Model (LLM) Integration: This is where InVoice OCR takes a leap forward. Instead of relying solely on basic text parsing techniques, it utilizes an LLM like Gemini. The extracted text is fed to the LLM, allowing it to understand the context and structure of the invoice.

Information Extraction: Gemini, with its advanced capabilities, goes beyond just recognizing characters. It can identify and extract crucial invoice fields like:

Merchant name
Invoice date
Item descriptions
Quantities
Prices
Total amount
Result Presentation: Finally, the extracted information is presented back to the user in a clear and organized format. This could be a table summarizing the invoice details or a downloadable file.

# Benefits of using a Large Language Model:

Improved Accuracy: LLMs can handle variations in invoice layouts and formatting, leading to more accurate data extraction compared to traditional methods.
Flexibility: The model can adapt to new invoice formats and data types over time, making the application future-proof.
Contextual Understanding: LLMs can understand the relationships between different data points, improving the overall quality of extracted information.
Streamlit plays a crucial role by:

Simplifying Development: Streamlit allows for rapid development of web applications with minimal coding effort.
User-Friendly Interface: It creates a user-friendly experience for uploading invoices and viewing extracted data.
In essence, InVoice OCR combines the strengths of Streamlit's user-friendly development and an LLM's powerful information extraction capabilities to create a robust and adaptable solution for invoice data processing.
